# SpirolaserPulsado

Arduino nano controlling:

* 4 fan mounted rotating mirrors (pwm on pin 3, 5, 6 and 11)
* 1.6w 450nm blue laser pulsing in the 200hz to few mhz range with very high stability and configured by a variable prescaler, duty circle and pulse period on the hardware 16bit Timer1. (pin 10 on nano)
* 7 analog inputs. 4 to the motors and 3 to laser modulation.

Laser driven by a Simpledrive 2.5A rev1
